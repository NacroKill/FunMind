FunMind
=======

FunMind is a Web app which provides a twist to the standard learning experience. It supplies fun games and specialized audio files that induce a desired state of mind, helping you learn in a more efficient way. This is primarily due to the reading software embedded in the application, that displays any copied text in a rapid fashion, allowing one to read faster with acceptable loss of comprehension. So you can think of FunMind as an ally that will entertain you, while also steering you in the right direction by expanding your learning capabilities.
